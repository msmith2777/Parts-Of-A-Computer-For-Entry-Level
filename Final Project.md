# Introduction To The Parts Of Computers

## By: Michael Smith

In this tutorial I am going to teach you about the parts of a computer and exactly what each part does.  
I am going to do so by using the parts I have in my computer.  

### Motherboard 
The motherboard is like the brain of the computer.  The motherboard is the central "mind" of the system the motherboard contains multiple slots and pins for different components.  The job of the motherboard is to communicate with every other part in order to make the system run smoothly.

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU is the operator of the system the motherboard receives the signals and then sends them to the processor to execute. The output that a CPU can handle is measured in GHz.  There is usually a fixed limit on how hard a CPU can work.  But with some like the one in my system the Intel I50-7600k the Processor can be over clocked.  What is meant by over clocked is the CPU works as hard as it can without putting any strain on the component.  The biggest worry with a CPU is overheating so you'll need a decent fan to keep it cool.

CPU overheat very easy and it is not cheap to replace. A good fan is one of the best investments you can purchase to keep your PC in good shape.  

### Hard Drive

The hard drive stores all information in the system.  There are two different types of hard drives HDD and SSD.  
HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive and contain all of the information on a disc. SSD stands for Solid State Drive and does not contain a disc instead it is 100% digitally stored. Number wise SSD is superior to HDD because of the speed in which information can be pulled.  

### RAM (Random-Access Memory)

RAM is used to remember and pull information from the last time the system was reset.  RAM can become crowded and can thus slow down your system so it is recommended to reset your computer every once in awhile.  

### Power Supply

The power supply is as it sounds it supplies power to the computer and the power is sent through the motherboard to be dispersed through the system.  

### CD Drive

The CD Drive is used read Cd's and can pull Music Pictures and even Operating systems off of them.  

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

The GPU is optional because most Motherboards have a built in GPU. The GPU is plugged into the motherboard and is the main component used in creating graphics for games.  

### Case

Finally we put all of those components in a case.  The Case has built in USB ports and Power buttons that need to be plugged into the motherboard. Cases can range from multiple different designs and some of the cases that are specialized for gamers are customized with lights.
